        <h4><i>Firefly's Blue Ghost Lander" credits to NASA</i></h4>
        NASA is developing a series of lunar deliveries and Firefly's Blue Ghost Lander will help mark the beginnings of controlled human existence on the Moon. The lander will be on the Moon for 14 days studying the intricate subsurface up to 700 miles deep. By exploring an untouched area of the moon, using magnetotellurics will help conduct analysis on surface and magnetic fields of Moon surface materials helping define their compositions.

        <h4>Lunar Magnetotelluric Sounder</h4>
        The LMS is the given name of the device that will help NASA explore the 350 mile wide basin, Mare Crisium, which is a large spot on the Moon visible from Earth. Since the Apollo missions were conducted West of the basin, the structure of the Moon is yet to be configured by the LMS which will be done so by recording the Moon's geophysical measurements. These will help determine closer results to the actual composition of the entire Moon.
